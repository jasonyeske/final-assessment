<p>My name is Jason. I was born and raised in Saskatchewan. 
    Ever since I was a youngling, I have always been a tech nerd. Whenever someone in the 
    family needs help with something tech related, I was always the one
    called on. It wasn't until highschool that I realized that I could actually
    make a career out of the thing I love to do, create internet content.

<ul class>
    <li><b>-</b> Ride my Minibike</li>
    <li><b>-</b> Spend time with my buddies</li>
      <li><b>-</b> Workout</li>
      <li><b>-</b> PC Game</li>
  
</ul>
